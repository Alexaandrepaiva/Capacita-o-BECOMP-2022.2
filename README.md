# Training of IME JÃºnior Computing Battalion Trainees

The Junior Enterprise of Military Institute of Engineering (IME) has a Computing Battalion that develops softwares and web applications. As member turnover is high, every semester there is training of new trainees where the current developpers teach the trainees how to code and the practices of the company. This is the repository that I used while I was in charge of this trainning and some extra projects to be used in future trainings. 

The training of trainees in the second half of 2022 aimed to teach new company members the basics of different languages so that they are able to improve and execute projects for the company. This repository contains the files used in this enablement.

<strong>Coordinator: </strong>Alexandre Paiva

<strong>Instructors: </strong>Alexandre Paiva, Luiz Braga, Thiago Vasconcellos, Ana Paula, Ivo Lin, Jean Crispim.

## General Training

The first part of the training is the general training part, in which all Trainees will learn HTLM, CSS and JavaScript. This part lasted a month and, at the end of it, the trainees were divided into groups of three people for a competition in which each group had to develop a website with a pre-defined theme only with the languages learned in the training.

#### HTML
#### CSS
#### JavaScript


## Specific Training

Then, the Trainees freely choose which area of the Computing Battalion they will be part of. From that choice, each area of the battalion has its own training.

### App Development
#### React

### Web development

## Extra Training

For those who are relevant, I will leave in this repository some files complementing some subjects of the training, as well as files for training in other programming languages.
